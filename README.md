Project Overview

This task is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.
The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset to understand factors affecting property prices.
EDA helps discover patterns, trends, relationships, and data quality issues before building predictive models.

Objective

Explore dataset structure and data types

Identify missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Analyze relationships between features and house prices

Prepare data for machine learning modeling

Dataset Description

The dataset contains features such as:

Area of the house

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Location

Furnishing status

Price (Target Variable)

Each row represents one house with its features.

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

EDA Steps

Loaded and inspected the dataset

Checked for missing values and duplicate records

Performed univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots)

Conducted bivariate analysis (scatter plots, group analysis)

Calculated correlations among numerical features

Key Insights

Larger houses (area) tend to cost more

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms positively affects price

Location and furnishing status influence pricing

Some outliers detected in the price column

Dataset is ready for preprocessing and predictive modeling
